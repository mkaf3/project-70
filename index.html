    <p class="text-muted" >McDonald's is an American corporation[3] that operates one of the largest chains of fast food restaurants in the world.[4]
      McDonald's has over 36,000 stores in 119 countries and territories, the second-most stores out of all fast food chains worldwide behind only the submarine sandwich chain Subway.[5] They serve almost 54 million people each day.[6]

    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize" >I had visited last week</h5>
    <p class="text-muted" >Cancún (pronounced as IPA: [kanˈkun]) is a coastal city in Mexico's easternmost state, Quintana Roo, on the Yucatán Peninsula. About 573,000 people live in Cancún, but over 4,000,000 tourists visit Cancún every year on vacation. At present it is, with Acapulco, the Mexican resort best known in the world.
      The resort is entirely artificial: few lived here before 1970. The first hotels were funded by the government.[1] February to May is wonderful weather most of the time,[2] and there are stunning white sand beaches. Even the sea is warm. There is now an airport, and bus connections to the rest of the Yucatán. The Yucatán has many Mayan sites, and some villages which are still mostly Mayan. </p>

    <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile</p>
